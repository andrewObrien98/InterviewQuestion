Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example:
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Here is the method signature:
"""

class Solution:
  def minSubArrayLen(self, nums, s):# brute force solution O(n^2)
      shortestLength = len(nums) + 1
      for i in range(len(nums)):
          if(nums[i] >= s):
              return 1
          currentLength = 0
          indexLength = 0
          for j in range(i, len(nums)):
              currentLength += nums[j]
              indexLength += 1
              if currentLength >= s:
                  if (indexLength) < shortestLength:
                      shortestLength = indexLength
      if shortestLength < len(nums) + 1:
          return shortestLength
      return 0
    # Fill this in

print( Solution().minSubArrayLen([2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3], 7))
# 2
